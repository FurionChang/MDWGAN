# MDWGAN - Multi-objective Driven Wasserstein Generative Adverserial Networks
This repo exhibits the code and data of the paper titled "Multi-objective Generative Design of Three-Dimensional Material Structures"

* Code

DC_GAN and LS_GAN were the models we modified before Wasserstein distance was confirmed as the best  with best performance for this task.

* Dataset

To demonstrate the capability of our framework, two-phase composites with symmetric and random reinforcement structures are generated. The mechanical performance of those strcutres calculated by FEM are also included. Dataset consist of the structures and their elastic performance can be found in ./Data folder.
